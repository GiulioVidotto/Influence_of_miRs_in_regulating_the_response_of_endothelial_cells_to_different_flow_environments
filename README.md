# Influence-of-miRs-in-regulating-the-response-of-endothelial-cells-to-different-flow-environments

This study investigated the role of flow-responsive micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in endothelial cells (ECs). The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing endothelial function in vascular health and disease. Further details and results will be shared upon the publication of the associated research paper.
